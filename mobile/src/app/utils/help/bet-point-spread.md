Point Spread: You’re betting on which participant will “cover the spread.” 
* When you back a favorite on the point spread, you’re backing them to win by a margin that’s greater than the size of the spread.
* When you back an underdog, you’re backing them to either win or lose by a margin that’s less than the size of the spread.
